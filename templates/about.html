                <h3>Graduation</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing my graduation at Malla Reddy University in the stream of Artificial Intelligence 
                    and Machine Learning (AIML). My academic focus is centered on strong problem-solving skills, 
                    application development, and core software fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, 
                    and system design concepts. I have a keen interest in machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics, where I work on applying theoretical concepts to real-world problems. Through hands-on projects and continuous practice, I aim to build efficient, scalable, and intelligent software solutions.

                <h3>Intermediate</h3>
                <p>
                    I completed my Intermediate education at Sri Chaitanya Junior College, 
                    Kukatpally, securing 939 marks, with a strong academic focus on Mathematics and Physics.
                    This phase helped me develop solid analytical, logical, and problem-solving skills,
                    forming a strong foundation for engineering and technology-oriented studies.

                <h3>Schooling</h3>
                <p>
                    I completed my schooling at Navketan Model School in 2021 under the SSC board. Along with academics, I actively participated in extracurricular 
                    activities and earned certificates in Chess and Kabaddi, 
                    which helped develop strategic thinking, teamwork, and leadership skills.
